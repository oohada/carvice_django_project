          <p>Carvice has a new face. After more than 20 years in business, we decided to give a fresher look to our
            brand and our services. With our fully renewed fleet of vehicles, we are ready to meet all expectations
            and requirements.</p>
          <p>Carvice is Philippines' most distinguished rental car company.
            We provide customers with approximately 850 locations and 42,000 vehicles throughout Philippines.
            As we are not affiliated with any specific automaker, we are able to provide a variety of vehicle makes
            and models for customers to rent.
            Rather than let vehicles age, we also replace our most popular passenger vehicles every few years.
            Replacing used vehicles eliminates uncomfortable wear and tear, and reduces the risk of breakdown and
            other inconveniences to our customers.
            The most trusted name in vehicle rentals.</p>
